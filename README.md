# FourierPlayground

**Interactive educational tool for exploring the Fourier Transform in 1D and 2D.**

This web-based application allows students and teachers to **visually and aurally explore Fourier Transforms**. Users can interactively add Gaussian components in the frequency domain and immediately see how they affect the direct-space (time or spatial) function. The tool is designed for intuitive learning, requiring minimal mathematical background.

## Features

### 2D Visualization
- **Frequency panel (left)**: Click to add 2D Gaussians in the Fourier domain.
- **Direct-space panel (right)**: Real-time inverse DFT updates.
- **Interactive controls**:
  - Scroll bar to adjust Gaussian width (`sigma`) in pixels.
  - Click-and-hold to increase amplitude.
  - Multiple clicks superimpose effects.
  - Clear button to reset panels.

### 1D Visualization and Sound
- **Frequency and direct-space panels** similar to 2D version but 1D.
- **Aligned 1D plots** under each panel for better understanding.
- **Play button**: Hear the sound corresponding to the current 1D function.
- Same scroll bar and clear button as 2D.

### Educational Goals
- Demonstrate the connection between the frequency domain and direct domain.
- Show how **localized frequencies** produce patterns in space or time.
- Provide **visual and auditory intuition** for Fourier concepts.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. Click on the frequency panels to add Gaussian components.
3. Adjust `sigma` using the scroll bar.
4. Observe the immediate changes in the direct-space panels.
5. For 1D, click **Play** to hear the corresponding sound.
6. Use **Clear** to reset the panels.

## Requirements
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- No server-side dependencies — works offline.
